## practical 7

This respository contains an extended version classes concept with files concept such as read(), readline(), readlines() concepts. It also includes menu driven program which incorportates classes concept moving the difficult of code one step further. 
I am Sathvika Subramanian, currently doing second semester in James Cook university, Singapore studying Bachelor of Science(Majoring in Data Science).

Three main points i learnt about clean code in this subject:
- Docstrings are used at the start of the function describing what the function performs or what task it does in triple quotes. hastag is used for inline comments purpose.
- DRY or dont repeat yourself is an important concept where the code lines are not repeated again to solve the problem.
- Proper indentation or spacing is a must between codelines for clarity
